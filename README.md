The Odin Project: Project Library

## Project Description:
The library application will allow the user to enter multiple book entries. The user is required with constraint validation
to enter inputs for the title, author, and pages per book entry. There is also a selection tag for the users to toggle if they have
read the book or not. Each book entry is an object initialized by a class.
